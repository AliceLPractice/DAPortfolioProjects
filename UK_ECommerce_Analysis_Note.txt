Contains orders from an E-commerce site (UK Retailer), with various products and orders.

Try starting with EDA and applying different functions to know more about the data. 
The dataset is tricky as it contains all the problems that an actual site may have.

Some hints to know what problems the dataset has:
Contains duplicates!! Check for it and remove them 
Contains missing values 
Has negative unit price, try to guess what could be the reason
Has negative quantity, try to guess what could be the reason
Apply a prescriptive analysis approach to data and find ways to increase sales.
This is an interesting task that builds up skills like business Intelligence.

--Problems found:
1. Removed duplicates by InvoiceNo+StockCode+InvoiceDate :10625

2. EDA(Exploratory data analysis)-Explored empty values/negative quantity and unit price
	- negative quantity 

3. more than 20k transactions cannot be loaded after mainpulated by Power Query
	-Casued by invalid invoice date format 
	 -Expected: dd/mm/yyyy, some of them m/dd/yyyy or mm/dd/yyyy

		--solution: check if m/dd/yyyy or mm/dd/yyyy--
		=IF(ISBLANK([@InvoiceDate]),"",IF(LEN([@InvoiceDate])=9,DATEVALUE(TEXT(DATE(RIGHT([@InvoiceDate],4),LEFT([@InvoiceDate],1),MID([@InvoiceDate],4,2)),"DD/MM/YYYY"),DATEVALUE(TEXT(DATE(RIGHT([@InvoiceDate],4),LEFT([@InvoiceDate],2),MID([@InvoiceDate],4,2)),"DD/MM/YYYY")))))
		
		part of the checking doesn't work, convert m/dd/yyyy to mm/dd/yyyy
		=IF(ISBLANK([@InvoiceDate]),"",IF(LEN([@InvoiceDate])=9,CONCAT("0",[@InvoiceDate])))
		=IF(ISBLANK($E55392),"",IF(LEN($E55392)=9,CONCAT("0",$E55392)))
		=IF(ISBLANK([@InvoiceDate2]),"",IF(LEN([@InvoiceDate2])=9,DATEVALUE(TEXT(DATE(RIGHT([@InvoiceDate2],4),LEFT([@InvoiceDate2],1),MID([@InvoiceDate2],4,2)),"DD/MM/YYYY"),TEXT(DATE(RIGHT([@InvoiceDate2],4),LEFT([@InvoiceDate2],2),MID([@InvoiceDate2],4,2)),"DD/MM/YYYY"))))
		
		=TEXT(DATE(RIGHT(A1,4),LEFT(A1,2),MID(A1,4,2)),"DD/MM/YYYY") & " " & TEXT(TIME(HOUR($E2)+3, MINUTE($E2), SECOND($E2)), "HH:MM:SS") & " GMT+00:00"

4. Spilted invoice date and time
